# 18F Visual Design
Resources, assets, and discussion focused on visual design issues.

This is a non-code repository. We use the [wiki](https://github.com/18F/visual-design/wiki) to gather common resources and assets that makes it easier to onboard new team members, and faster to respond to common questions from others.
